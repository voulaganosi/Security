# FZC 1.05c sample wordlist
#
# Lines beginning with a "#" are ignored and can be used to store
# wordlist information, comments, etc.
#
# You can get some very good wordlists from:
#       ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/security/coast/dict/wordlists
#       ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/security/coast/dict/dictionaries
#       ftp://ftp.ox.ac.uk/pub/wordlists
#
# Many wordlists are compressed (.Z or .gz).  To uncompress them try:
#       ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/simtelnet/msdos/compress/gzip124.zip
#       ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/simtelnet/msdos/arcers/tar320g.zip
#
# Finally, to sort/merge wordlists get:
#       ftp://ftp.fc.net/pub/phrack/underground/misc/jack14.zip
#
# Note1: FZC will use only the first 32 characters of the words.
#
# Note2: The EOL can be either LF (*ix) or CR/LF (DOS).
#        A [CR/]LF in the last line is optional.
#        The EOF is 0x1A (26 dec = ^Z) and is optional.
